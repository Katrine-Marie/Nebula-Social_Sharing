# Nebula_Social-Sharing

A Wordpress plugin to correctly insert the meta information social media sites need, in order to display links from your site properly.

## Why Use This?
When users share a link to your site on a social network, the network will pick the content to display - and that might be simply the first image and the first bit of text on your site it finds, which could be your logo and some text from a sidebar. In other words, it might look strange.

That is, unless you specify otherwise. This plugin inserts the necessary code to get the RIGHT piece of text, and the RIGHT image to display when your content is shared. An image related to the post or page, and an excerpt from the text of the post or page.

You can also set some default options in the dashboard. This could be, for instance, your page's and author's Twitter handles. Or, if perhaps you want to set a default image to display when none is present in the content.
