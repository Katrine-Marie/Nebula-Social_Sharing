		Welcome to the Plugin Release Information Page for the Nebula Social Sharing plugin.
	</p>

	<h2>Social Signals</h2>

	<p>
		This plugin adds the social signals to individual posts and pages so that when they are shared, they include the post or page heading, an excerpt of the content, the featured image and links to your Twitter account. This makes the data effective for both Facebook and Twitter sharing.
